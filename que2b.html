              <p>Our memory is in large part the starting point for how we think, how our
                preferences form, and how we make decisions. It is the attic’s content that
                distinguishes even an otherwise identically structured mind from its neighbor’s.
                What Holmes means when he talks about stocking your attic with the
                appropriate furniture is the need to carefully choose which experiences, which
                memories, which aspects of your life you want to hold on to beyond the moment
                when they occur. (He should know: he would not have even existed as we know
                him had Arthur Conan Doyle not retrieved his experiences with Dr. Joseph Bell
                from memory in creating his fictional detective.) He means that for a police
                inspector, it would be well to remember past cases, even seemingly obscure
                ones: aren’t they, in a sense, the most basic knowledge of his profession?</p>

              <p>In the earliest days of research, memory was thought to be populated with socalled engrams, memory traces that were localized in specific parts of the brain.
                To locate one such engram—for the memory of a maze—psychologist Karl
                Lashley taught rats to run through a labyrinth. He then cut out various parts of
                their brain tissue and put them right back into the maze. Though the rats’ motor
                function declined and some had to hobble or crawl their way woozily through
                the twists and turns, the animals never altogether forgot their way, leading
                Lashley to conclude that there was no single location that stored a given
                memory. Rather, memory was widely distributed in a connected neural network
                —one that may look rather familiar to Holmes.</p>
